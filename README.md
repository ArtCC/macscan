# 🛡️ MacScan

**Command-line malware scanner for macOS** — Simple, fast, and transparent.

MacScan is an open-source CLI tool designed to scan your Mac for malware, adware, and potentially unwanted software. Built for power users and security researchers who prefer the terminal over bloated GUI applications.

## ✨ Features

- **Quick Scan** — Scan common threat locations (Downloads, Desktop, Documents, Applications)
- **Full System Scan** — Deep scan of your entire system
- **Path Scan** — Scan specific directories
- **Real-time Progress** — See current file being scanned with counter
- **Quarantine** — Isolate and manage infected files safely
- **Whitelist** — Exclude trusted paths from scans
- **JSON Export** — Export scan results for automation
- **macOS Notifications** — Native alerts on scan completion
- **Interactive TUI** — Arrow-key menu navigation with keyboard shortcuts
- **Lightweight** — Pure Bash with ClamAV backend
- **Transparent** — Open source, no telemetry, no network requests
- **Safe** — No auto-delete, all actions require confirmation

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/artcc/macscan.git
cd macscan

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

The installer will check for dependencies and offer to install them:
- **Homebrew** — Package manager for macOS (if not installed)
- **ClamAV** — Open-source antivirus engine (if not installed)

The installer will also offer to initialize the virus database automatically.

### Manual Prerequisites

If you prefer to install dependencies manually:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if needed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install ClamAV
brew install clamav
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode (TUI menu)
ms

# Quick scan (common threat locations)
ms scan

# Scan a specific directory
ms scan --path ~/Downloads

# Full system scan
ms scan --full

# Preview what will be scanned (with whitelist)
ms scan --dry-run

# Silent scan with notification
ms scan --quiet --notify

# Export results to JSON
ms scan --export results.json

# Update virus signatures
ms update

# Show status and last scan info
ms status

# Manage whitelisted paths
ms whitelist list
ms whitelist add ~/safe-folder

# Manage quarantined files
ms quarantine list
ms quarantine restore <id>

# Uninstall MacScan
ms remove

# Show version and author info
ms version
ms author

# Show help
ms help
```

## 🎮 Interactive Mode

Run `ms` without any arguments to launch the interactive menu:

```bash
ms
```

This opens a TUI with arrow key navigation:

```

## 📁 Directory Structure

MacScan follows the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html):

```
/usr/local/bin/
├── macscan                 # Main command
└── ms                      # Short alias

~/.config/macscan/          # Configuration
├── config.conf             # User settings
├── whitelist               # Scan exclusions
├── bin/                    # Installed scripts
└── lib/                    # Library modules

~/.local/share/macscan/     # Persistent data
├── quarantine/             # Isolated threats
└── logs/                   # Scan history

~/.cache/macscan/           # Temporary cache
└── last_scan               # Last scan info
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration file: `~/.config/macscan/config.conf`

```ini
# Example configuration
verbose=0
auto_update=1
```

### Whitelist

Exclude paths from scanning using the `whitelist` command:

```bash
# List whitelisted paths
ms whitelist list

# Add a path to whitelist
ms whitelist add ~/Library/Caches

# Remove a path from whitelist
ms whitelist remove ~/Library/Caches

# Edit whitelist manually
ms whitelist edit
```

Or edit the file directly at `~/.config/macscan/whitelist`:

```
# Lines starting with # are comments
/path/to/exclude
/another/path
```

### Database Age Warning

MacScan automatically warns you if the virus database is older than 7 days before each scan. Keep your database updated with:

```bash
ms update
```

## 🧪 Development

### Project Structure

```

### Running from Source

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/artcc/macscan.git
cd macscan

# Run directly without installing
./bin/ms scan
./bin/ms --help
```

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

```bash
# If installed
ms remove

# Or run the uninstaller directly
~/.config/macscan/uninstall.sh

# Or from the source directory
./uninstall.sh
```

This will remove:
- `/usr/local/bin/macscan` and `/usr/local/bin/ms`
- `~/.config/macscan/`
- `~/.local/share/macscan/`
- `~/.cache/macscan/`

> Note: ClamAV is not removed. To remove it: `brew uninstall clamav`
